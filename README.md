# Bonus.ly Multi Points

Give out Bonus.ly bonuses, 1 point at a time.

It is a bit cheeky to do it, but you get more points as a "giver" this way :)

## Example Usage

You will need an access token to run this.

This example will send 1 point to a@b.com, 10 times.

    bonusly-mp -token abc -points 10 -email a@b.com -reason "for the lulz #wat"

User a@b.com ends up with 10 bonus points, and you gave 10 times. Everybody
wins!
